==== What is this?
It is a library for humans (and some robots). This library is a client
of Scratch API, so lots of features are available. But the development
team decided to remove all deprecated features.

It consists of some classes, such as:
* Misc (Information, Search, Statistics)
* Translate (Translate API)
* User (Scratch user)
* Project (Scratch project)
* FrontPage (Scratch Front Page API)
* Classroom (Scratch classroom)
* Comment
* Studio
and some classes just for developers...

==== Requirements
* Python 3.0+, should be 3.5+, tested on CPython 3.6.1
* Requests (should be the latest version)

==== For people who want to add a feature
The ScratchAPI2 Development Team needs help. See this for detail:
https://github.com/apple502j/scratchapi2/issues/2
1. Make sure the API exists! Test by YOURSELF.
2. If it needs CSRF token, make the code, PLEASE MAKE IT!
3. Please tell at least one reference. Available references:

==== (By the way) Story
On June 9th, apple502j, the programmer on the team started making it.
When making, Kenny2scratch always helps. The great co-worker made this
library greater. For example, GenericData was made by him.

On July 4th, the library had a great update by him. His codes made this
library better and better.
